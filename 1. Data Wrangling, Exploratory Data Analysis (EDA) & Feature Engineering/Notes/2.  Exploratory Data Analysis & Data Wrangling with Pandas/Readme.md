# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Wrangling with Pandas

Welcome to this project! In this session, we'll dive deep into **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Wrangling** using the powerful Python library — **Pandas** 🐼.

---

## 📌 What is Data Wrangling?

**Data Wrangling** is the process of transforming **raw**, **unstructured**, or **messy** data into a clean and usable format.

Real-world data often:
- Comes from multiple sources 🌐
- Is unstructured or inconsistent 🧩
- Contains missing or duplicate entries ❌

### 🔧 Key Data Wrangling Tasks:
- Selecting important features
- Removing unnecessary/outlier information
- Applying domain knowledge to enhance data
- Handling missing values 🕳️
- Merging datasets from multiple sources 📦
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., 🇺🇸 US → 0, 🇫🇷 France → 1)
- Formatting inconsistent data (e.g., `Yes` vs. `1`)
- Removing duplicates (e.g., repeated rows)

📊 **Fun Fact:** Data scientists spend nearly **80%** of their time performing Data Wrangling and EDA!

## 🧠 What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

**EDA** is the process of analyzing data to gain meaningful **insights** and understand data structure through:
- Statistical summaries (mean, min, max, std. deviation, etc.)
- Visualizations 📈 (covered in future projects)

---

## 🛠️ Project Goals

In this project, we will analyze **Human Resources data** using **Pandas**. The main objectives are:

### ✅ Learn to:
- Perform **statistical analysis** on real-world datasets 📉
  - Mean, max, min, standard deviation, etc.
- Handle **missing values** with pandas
- Perform **one-hot encoding** of categorical data 🧠
- Apply **normalization vs standardization** 📏
- Define a custom function and apply it to a DataFrame column 🧩
- Use **Pandas operations** for filtering and transformation
- Calculate and visualize **correlation matrices** using **Seaborn** 🔥

---

## 🧪 Tools Used

- 🐼 **Pandas** – Open-source data analysis library for Python
- 📊 **Seaborn** (for visualizing heatmaps later)

---

## 🎯 Summary

By the end of this project, you’ll be able to:
- Clean messy data
- Explore and understand dataset structures
- Prepare datasets for machine learning tasks
- Gain deeper insights using basic statistics and transformations

Stay tuned for the next lesson where we dive into **Google Colab** & start coding! 💻
